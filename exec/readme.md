## Standalone Package of Pfeature 
### Introduction: 
Pfeature is a standalone software package for computing wide range of protein and peptides features from their amino acid 
sequences.  It has the following five major modules for computing protein features based on: i) Composition, ii) Binary profiles, 
iii) Evolutionary information iv) Structure and v) Pattern.  We have developed number of forms of Pfeature that include: i) A web server 
that uses Pfeature functions via web interface from https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pfeature/ ; ii) Standalone version of Pfeature; 
iii) Library of python for Pfeature and iv) Python scripts for computing features.

This is a standalone version of Pfeature (executables), we have generated executables of Pfeature that can be executed on different platform. 

### Installation
Installation of Pfeature is simple as executables are available for  different operating systems (Windows, Ubuntu, Mac, Fedora, Centos). Following are main steps to install Pfeature on different operating systems.
<br>
#### On Microsoft Windows:

4.	Run the command: ./pfeature_centos -i <input_file> -o <output_file> -m <options> <br>
  
### Folders & Files
Following is brief description of folders/files in the folder Pfeature_OS.
Data: This folder contains csv files for different parameters required to run Pfeature <br>
example.seq : It is an example input file containing sequence of peptides (one sequence per line) <br>
example.out: An example output file corresponding to example.seq <br>
Features_Table.pdf : File provides description of features in different columns in output file <br>
lib: contain libraries required for package <br>
pfeature_os : Executable file, where os is operating system like win, mac, ubuntu. <br>
README : This file <br>

Commands for running Pfeature <br>
exec –i <input_file> -o <output_file> -m <options> <br>
where,  
•	exec:  executable depending on the OS (e.g., pfeature_ubuntu, pfeature_mac)                          
•	input_file: file contain sequence of peptides/proteins <br> 
•	output_file:  this is output file generated by Pfeature <br>
•	options:  Pfeature support following options <br>
  
1 for Composition based feature <br>
2 for Autocorrelation features <br> 
3 for Binary pofile  <br>
4 for all features <br>
For more type exec –-help or exec –h <br>
